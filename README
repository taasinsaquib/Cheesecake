# cheesecake

Inspired by our love of UCLA cheesecake, we created a simple script
to tell you exactly when and where your favorite menu item will be
served

### Running it

To save the menus in json format, run food.py after changing
the start and end dates for the range of dates that you want
to search. This should create a folder called dates with all of the files

So execute queries, run analyze.py like so:

```python
python analyze.py FoodItem_name
```

Enjoy!
